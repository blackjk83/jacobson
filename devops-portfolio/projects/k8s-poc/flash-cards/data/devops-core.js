        question: "What is DevOps? Explain it in simple terms.",
        answer: "DevOps is a way of working where development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams collaborate closely throughout the entire software development lifecycle. It's about breaking down silos, automating processes, and focusing on continuous improvement to deliver software faster and more reliably."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the key benefits of DevOps?",
        answer: "• Faster Time to Market: Automated processes and continuous delivery\n• Improved Quality: Continuous testing and integration\n• Increased Efficiency: Automation reduces manual effort\n• Better Collaboration: Dev and Ops teams work together\n• Reduced Risk: Smaller, more frequent releases\n• Higher Customer Satisfaction: Faster delivery\n• Improved Recovery: Faster and reliable rollbacks"
    },
    {
        question: "Explain the difference between Agile and DevOps.",
        answer: "Agile is a software development methodology focused on iterative development and flexibility. DevOps is a culture and set of practices that extends Agile principles to the entire software delivery lifecycle, including operations. Agile focuses on how software is developed, while DevOps encompasses how software is developed, deployed, and operated."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?",
        answer: "Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, rather than manual processes. This code is stored in version control and treated like any other software code. Benefits include consistency, repeatability, automation, and reduced errors."
    },
    {
        question: "Explain the concept of 'Shift Left' in DevOps.",
        answer: "Shift Left refers to moving testing, security checks, and other quality assurance activities earlier in the development lifecycle. Instead of waiting until the end to test, testing is integrated into each stage of development. This helps catch issues sooner, when they are easier and cheaper to fix."
