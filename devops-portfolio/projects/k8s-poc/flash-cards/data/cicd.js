        question: "What is CI/CD?",
        answer: "CI (Continuous Integration) automatically integrates code changes and runs tests. CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) automates the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments."
    },
    {
        question: "Difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?",
        answer: "Continuous Delivery automates up to staging, requiring manual approval for production deployment. Continuous Deployment automates the entire pipeline including production deployment, with no manual intervention."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Jenkins?",
        answer: "Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers around the world to build, test, and deploy their software faster and more reliably."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Git?",
        answer: "Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development."
    },
    {
        question: "What is GitHub?",
        answer: "GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service that offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features."
    },
    {
        question: "What is GitLab?",
        answer: "GitLab is a web-based Git repository hosting service that offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a pipeline in CI/CD?",
        answer: "A pipeline is a series of automated steps that code goes through from development to production, typically including stages like build, test, and deploy."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Docker and how does it relate to CI/CD?",
        answer: "Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and dependencies together. In CI/CD, it ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a build artifact?",
        answer: "A build artifact is the output produced by building your source code, such as compiled code, packages, or container images, which can be deployed to different environments."
    },
    {
        question: "What are environment variables in CI/CD?",
        answer: "Environment variables are dynamic values used to store sensitive information (like API keys) and configuration settings that can vary between different deployment environments."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?",
        answer: "Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes, often used in CI/CD pipelines."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a deployment strategy?",
        answer: "A deployment strategy is a method for releasing applications to production, such as blue-green deployment, canary releases, or rolling updates, to minimize downtime and risk."
    },
    {
        question: "What are CI/CD best practices?",
        answer: "Key best practices include: maintaining a single source of truth, automating tests, keeping builds fast, using version control for everything, and implementing security scanning in the pipeline."
